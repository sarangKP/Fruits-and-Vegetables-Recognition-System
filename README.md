Project Name: Fruits and Vegetables Recognition System

Studying the Basic Idea of the project:
	By taking reference from a YouTube video (Fruits and Vegetables Recognition System | Machine Learning project) understood the Outline of the project we are planning to create by utilizing Google Collab 

Outline for creating Model:
1.	Importing Dataset
2.	Importing Libraries
3.	Data preprocessing -> Training Image & Validation Image
4.	Building Model -> Using CNN (Convolution Neutral Network)
5.	Compiling and Training Phase
6.	Saving the Model and finally Testing the Accuracy
